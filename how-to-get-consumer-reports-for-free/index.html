From the consumerist website :</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://dennis-jonesa.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2c/0f/cd/2c0fcd79e9154eaac4a175275ea9db9c.png alt="Consumer Reports’ Mosquito Repellent Rankings Are Now" title="Consumer Reports’ Mosquito Repellent Rankings Are Now" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://dennis-jonesa.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
