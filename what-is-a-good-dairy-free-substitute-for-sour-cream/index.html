If you don�t want to miss out on the light tang that sour cream adds to a baked good, try using 3/4 cup of canned coconut milk with a splash of vinegar for every 1 cup of sour cream. Drain and rinse the cashew nuts. Sour cream can take the place of whole milk, half and half, cream, skim milk and buttermilk.</p><p>This site is an open community for users to do submittion their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site convienient, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also save this blog page with the title what is a good dairy free substitute for sour cream by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
