Look at the seat and keep it at the level of your hip. Different positions on the bike are also used to target different muscles. Given that it only has one studio, you can schedule another class before or after your spin session to make the most out of your time spent there. Be conscious of the setup functions of the bike.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://dennis-bej.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cf/b4/34/cfb434893908f0bac252e151f92bc075.jpg alt="Free 20Minute SpinÂ® Workout for Beginners and" title="Free 20Minute SpinÂ® Workout for Beginners and" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://dennis-bej.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
