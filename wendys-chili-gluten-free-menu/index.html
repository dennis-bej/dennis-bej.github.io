These are all of the protein options at wendy’s that do not contain wheat or gluten ingredients: We have seen reports that wendy’s uses the meat from unsold burgers in their chili (and therefore the meat contacted the buns and could be contaminated), however, a former wendy’s employee commented below (see comments section) that this does not happen. Wendy’s has a decent amount of options if you’re looking to avoid gluten.
