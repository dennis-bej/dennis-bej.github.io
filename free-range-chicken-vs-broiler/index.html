Hubbard’s colored broiler is a meat type bird that has a comparable taste if not better taste to our philippine native chicken. Most commercial broilers reach slaughter weight between four and seven weeks of age, although slower growing breeds reach slaughter weight at approximately 14 weeks of age. They are a great alternative to the cornish cross which grows very quickly and is bred to produce in confinement. Whether permitting, these chickens are able to go to pasture to roam free.
