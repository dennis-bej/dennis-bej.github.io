Jostens prints millions of yearbooks each year, therefore we are unable to keep inventories of backdated yearbooks in stock. Yearbooks are one of those home sources, usually found in an attic or basement, which many people don�t think of as a family history source. Yearbooks can help you locate an individual, or at least provide clues that lead to other sources.
