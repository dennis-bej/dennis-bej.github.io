This may be free (as with creative commons or public domain music) or you may need to pay a licensing fee. This includes soundtracks, instrumentals, and even vocals if you need them! The best option is to secure the permission of the copyright owner to use their music on youtube and to have the owner retract the claim. Add music to their youtube videos and then upload them to their youtube studio.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://dennis-jonesa.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6c/9e/9e/6c9e9ed27ed8a9d6371210de01591ba9.jpg alt="The SingerTracy Lawrence Studio (With images) Tracy" title="The SingerTracy Lawrence Studio (With images) Tracy" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://dennis-jonesa.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
