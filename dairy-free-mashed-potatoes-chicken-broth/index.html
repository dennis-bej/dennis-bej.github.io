These dairy free garlic mashed potatoes don�t need no stinkin� milk and butter to be great! Whether you like your mashed potatoes lightly mashed and chunky or smooth and creamy with no lumps, using chicken broth in place of milk or cream makes them super flavorful. Add the other half of chicken broth if needed (depending on how much water your veggies will retain, you may not need as much of broth to make them smooth and creamy). Add coconut milk, chicken broth, ghee, garlic powder and salt and either mash with a potato masher for chunkier mashed potatoes, or use an immersion blender or food processor to blend until smooth.</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://dennis-bej.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1c/ab/3e/1cab3e523d05c9c7196fea3d64578314.jpg alt="Creamy Garlic Dairy Free Mashed Potatoes Recipe" title="Creamy Garlic Dairy Free Mashed Potatoes Recipe" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://dennis-bej.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
