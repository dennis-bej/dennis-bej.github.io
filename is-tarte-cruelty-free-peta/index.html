Major beauty brands such as urban decay, tarte, too faced, and hundreds of others have already ditched fur—urge sephora to do the same. How is it that makeup can be made in china, but also be cruelty free? They also don�t sell their products where animal testing is required by law. You’ve probably heard of becca cosmetics, they’re huge in the makeup game!</p><p><img loading=lazy width=100% src=https://dennis-bej.github.io/img/placeholder.svg data-src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/59/cc/0759ccca486cb096543498772f0e154b.jpg alt="Pin de alejandra rios en Favoritos Favoritos" title="Pin de alejandra rios en Favoritos Favoritos" onerror="this.onerror=null,this.src='https://dennis-bej.github.io/img/placeholder.svg'" class=center>
Source: pinterest.com</p><p>Peta and my beauty bunny seem to have taken the position that tarte is still cruelty free, and that it’s acceptable for tarte to continue to market itself as such. Even though they claim to not test on animals, they choose to sell in a country that requires imported cosmetics to be tested on animals. All of our products are formulated without parabens, mineral oil, phthalates, sodium lauryl sulfate, triclosan, synthetic fragrances and gluten, just to name a few. Another important fact to consider is that in 2014, tarte was acquired by kose corporation, a japanese company which sells its products in china and is listed on peta as a company that tests on animals. Are tarte products gluten free?</p><p>This site is an open community for users to share their favorite wallpapers on the internet, all images or pictures in this website are for personal wallpaper use only, it is stricly prohibited to use this wallpaper for commercial purposes, if you are the author and find this image is shared without your permission, please kindly raise a DMCA report to Us.</p><p>If you find this site good, please support us by sharing this posts to your favorite social media accounts like Facebook, Instagram and so on or you can also bookmark this blog page with the title is tarte cruelty free peta by using Ctrl + D for devices a laptop with a Windows operating system or Command + D for laptops with an Apple operating system.
